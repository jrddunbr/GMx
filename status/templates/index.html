    <p class="indent">
      Modpack wth most tech mods, and some magic mods to change it up. The structure of the world is very special, due to the nature of the world. The world is a map of the continental US, which is ingame about 12km across, and we have scattered "admin producers" across the world. What happens is that instead of mining, you have to make train tracks to these locations (which are mostly established, but shoddy), and make factories to make materials on a very large scale.
